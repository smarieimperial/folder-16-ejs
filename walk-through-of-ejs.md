ejs is a ___templating___ engine

templating allows us to reuse html code

why did we have express in this application?
	
	because we have the routes

		we have urls 

			and responses


the folder that ejs uses for files is ___views___

	it must be spelled exactly like that

	the __views__ folder doesn't get put inside of the public folder


you can't use ejs in the public folder

you can't use ejs anywhere other than the views folder

the views folder is always in the base of the application where server.js is
